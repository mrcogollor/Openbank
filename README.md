In the project directory, you can run:

# :tropical_drink: Openbank Code Test :tropical_drink:

Code challenge made in react and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<hr>

## :file_folder: File Structure :file_folder:

The file structure is based in componentes and pages that render differents views connected to each route.

[React Material](https://material-ui.com/components/steppers) was used to perform a Stepper, with three different <Step> component.

[BONUS]: A error component was develop to redirect to error pages (routes not defined)
[BONUS]: Clue input text has a counter caracter

Another approach to develop test code will be, instead of using react-stepper, develop a stepper and include [React-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to delegate every validation of the password inputs
